\chapter{Overview}

Needle is a lightweight framework for testing Java EE components outside of the
container in isolation. It reduces the test setup code by analysing dependencies and
automatic injection of mock objects. It will thus maximize the speed of development as well as the execution of unit tests.

\section{Features}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Instantiation of @ObjectUnderTest Components
	\item Constructor, Method and Field based dependency injection
	\item Injection of Mock objects by default
	\item Extensible by providing custom injection providers
	\item Wiring of object graphs

	\item Database testing via JPA Provider, e.g. EclipseLink or Hibernate
	\item EntityManager creation and injection
	\item Execute optional database operations during test setup and tear down
	\item Transaction Utilities

	\item Provide Utilities for Reflection, e.g. for private method invocation or field access

	\item Needle can be used with JUnit or TestNG.
	\item It supports EasyMock and Mockito out-of-the-box.
