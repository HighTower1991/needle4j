\chapter{Overview}

Needle is a lightweight framework for testing Java EE components outside of the
container in isolation. The main goals are the reduction of setup code
and faster executions of tests, especially compared to running embedded or external server tests.

Needle will automatically analyse the dependencies of components and inject
mock objects by default. The developer may freely provide default or custom objects instead.
