\chapter{Overview}

Needle is a lightweight framework for testing Java EE components outside of the
container in isolation. It reduce the test setup code by analysing dependencies and
automatically injection of mock objects. Therefore it will thus maximize the speed of development and execution of unit tests.

\section{Features}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Instantiation of @ObjectUnderTest Components
	\item Constructor, Method and Field based dependency injection
	\item Injection of Mock objects by default
	\item Extensible by providing custom injection provider
	\item Wiring of object graphs

	\item Database testing via JPA Provider, e.g. EclipseLink or Hibernate
	\item EntityManager creation and injection
	\item Execute optional database operation on test setup and tear down
	\item Transaction Utilities

	\item Provide Utilities for Reflection, e.g. for private method invocation or field access

	\item Needle can used with JUnit or TestNG.
	\item It supports out of the box EasyMock and Mockito as mock framework.
